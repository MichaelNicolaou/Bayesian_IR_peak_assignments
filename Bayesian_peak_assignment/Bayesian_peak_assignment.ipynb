    "This script is used to perform Bayesian inference to determine what are possible assignments of theoretical DFT vibrational frequency calculations to experimentally observed IR absorption peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires that an excel database with the DFT-calculated frequencies and an IR spectrum text dump is available, for formatting, see below (where the images of excel spreadsheets are).\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of IR spectra make it difficult to associate with theoretical frequency calculations, as we expect that the DFT-calculation will predict a frequency within a range of deviation from the real, experimental peak. While it can be an easier case for molecules such as Vanillin, when a lot of peaks are involved in a smaller space (such as Syringaldehyde), or the spectral peaks are broadened (such as Hydroxybenzaldehyde), it quickly becomes a difficult and uncertain problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's not going to lead to an exact answer, a Sudoku-esque approach can be taken to make some sense out of the spectral pattern, using deduction based on clues such as \"if theoretical frequency \"x\" goes to experimental peak \"x\", then theoretical frequency \"y\" doesn't fit anywhere\". \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the kind of logic that this script and approach are attempting to utilise to present options that make sense in terms of assignment. While a metric is included and called \"Probability\", it essentially indicates how good the fit is, and it is very possible that the chosen answer won't be the \"most likely\", as other clues such as intensity and chemical sense are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "An assumption applied here is that ALL theoretical frequencies chosen will be represented experimentally, and as such only identifiable and trusted vibrational modes are chosen. While it might sound like bad practise to hold the theoretical frequencies as indicative of what the experimental peaks should be, the opposite cannot be applied, as the experimental peaks will always be more than the theoretical frequencies, due to phenomena that DFT cannot account for (combination bands, Fermi resonance, higher state vibrations beyond the fundamental, phenomena such as hydrogen bonding, etc...)."

To use that, simply specify the molecule in the \"if\" line and the threshold to be used.

    "1. Hypotheses in this case are considered to be all possible complete sets of assignments of theoretical frequencies to experimental peaks, e.g.: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] is an example hypothesis here, which specifies that theoretical frequency number 1 is assigned to Experimental peak number 2 (The first value indicates that it's the experimental value that we assign to the FIRST theoretical frequency, in this case, experimental peak number 2). As there are 2016 possible sets (i.e. unique sets in which all theoretical frequencies are assigned to different experimental peaks within the threshold range), we assume that there are 2016 possible hypotheses that need to be tested.\n",

    "    * As an analogy, consider a problem where we have 5 keys and 3 locks, we know that 3 of those keys will belong to the 3 locks. In this case, if we try a key on lock 1 and find that it opens it, then the probability of key 2 belonging to lock 2 would be affected, as now we know that we have 4 keys and 2 locks. This is analogous to saying that we have 21 detected experimental peaks and 14 theoretical peaks, assuming that all 14 theoretical peaks must be peaks that can be detected experimentally (from DFT-calculation and chemical knowledge). Therefore, assigning as an example theoretical frequency 1 to experimental peak 1 affects the probability of all other peaks. The difference here is that we are 100% sure that key 1 opens lock 1 in this scenario, this wouldn't be the case for our peaks, but instead, we use a probability (a measure of how well the theoretical frequency fits to the experimental peak, see image below). This means that the final inference for each hypothesis will be a product of well all the theoretical frequencies fit to their assigned experimental peaks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Perhaps the most significant issue this method deals with is considering all other peak assignments as well as the one in the current iteration. This means that not just the closeness of a frequency to a peak is taken into consideration, but also how well the rest of the frequencies will fit with other peaks if this assignment is assumed.\n",

The \"mean\" value represents the most likely frequency, and how \"likely\" other frequencies are to be calculated as fall within the distribution, in this case, a theoretical frequency of 1274 cm${^-1}$ was selected. The image represents a visual representation of this concept. \n",
