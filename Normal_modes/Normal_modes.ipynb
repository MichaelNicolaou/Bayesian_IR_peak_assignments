    "The purpose of this script is to take the variables file and the excel spreadsheet (Molecule_Normal_modes) produced by the \"Pipeline for Gaussian results\" script (Pipeline_Gaussian) and extract high contributing normal mode displacements (i.e. the molecular movements expressed as bond stretching/bending/wagging that are most intensive in a vibrational mode) for a selection of normal modes given by the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, bond \"stretching\" is defined as a change in bond length (R) between 2 atoms, bond \"bending\" is defined as a change in bond angle (A) between 3 atoms and bond \"wagging\" is defined as a change in dihedral bond angle (D) between 4 atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Combined\" contribution modes in this script refer to two displacements that show the same atomic \"movement\" (e.g. if we imagine a hydrogen atom on the ortho-position of a benzene ring (Carbons named C1, C2 ... C6 clock-wise), performing an in-plane bending vibration, the same vibration is described by the change between both the H-C2-C1 and H-C2-C3 bond angles) and so if both of those changes add up to a significant contribution, they are are also included. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other scripts, this script is intended to be used as a functional tool by itself rather than just produce a flow of data. The user can select a molecule and a list of normal modes (as they are indexed in the Gaussian results file) and the script will produce a dictionary of dictionaries of all displacements with their contributions for all vibrational modes (i.e. a labelled 2-column \"table\" in which each row represents each selected vibrational mode, giving access to another storage order of each vibrational mode's \"Stretching\", \"Bending\" and \"Wagging\" vibrations as a table with each important displacement (>4% selected here) and its percentage contribution).\n",
